Thus, the appropriate test for a 'diversity effect' is the proportional deviation in prey density in the 3 predator species system from the expected values.  Expected values were calculated from the multiplicative risk model (1-P1)*(1-P2)*(1-P3) ... where Pi is the proportion of aphids killed by each of the 3 predator species when alone, calculted as the deviation from controls.  Effects of predator richness are reported relative to predator monocultures.",.,.,.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,18,.,6,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,Harmonia axyridis,1.6663,5.5438,.,4.4338,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,2.5176,2.9675,.,3.1127,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,6,4.434,3.113,-0.223,0.098,0.614,N,0.979,0.463,1.333,N,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,,I,Y,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,.,,,,,,,,.,.,.,.,"Study reports statistical tests showing non-additive enemy interactions, but it's not clear how to translate this into effects metrics."77,16,29,29,Dang et al. 2005,F2,TD,4,RD,C,proportional change,Original units: g L-1,Fungi (Hyphomycete),Plantae (Alnus glutinosa leaf litter),A,2,1,3,2,S,"Laboratoire Dynamique de la Biodiversite, UMR 5172 CNRSUPS, 29, rue Jeanne Marvig, 31055 Toulouse Cedex, France",43.57,1.46,.,lat long of address of first author,5,12,8,.,0.05,,,.,28,10,0.357142857,-1.029619417,N,Y,1,N,"CJ, BC, KM","Figure legend does not state whether error bars are SD's or SEM's.

Thus, even while Figure 1a shows that aphid densities declined as predator richness increased, increasing predator diversity actually led to an increase in prey density due to antagonistic interactions among predators (Figure 1b).  Thus, the appropriate test for a 'diversity effect' is the proportional deviation in prey density in the 3 predator species system from the expected values.  Expected values were calculated from the multiplicative risk model (1-P1)*(1-P2)*(1-P3) ... where Pi is the proportion of aphids killed by each of the 3 predator species when alone, calculted as the deviation from controls.
